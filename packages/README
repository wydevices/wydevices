Wydev packages building scripts
================================

This folder contains scripts to build packages for the wydevice.
Every package has its own directory where running the build.sh
script will build a tar.gz that can be directly installed under /wymedia.

Build a package
-----------------

Enter the directory of the package you want to build
$ cd extras
And run the build.sh script with the option you want:
$ ../build.sh wyboxpkg


Create a package
-------------------

Create a new dir with the name of the package and create
a build.config file. There is an template of this file in
build.config.example.


Available build.sh options
----------------------------

 $ ./build.sh OPTION

     * sources : only download and compile
     * wyboxfiles : generate 'usr' folder
     * wyboxpkg (tar.gz) : generate tar.gz file
     * transfer IP: transfer usr folder to rsync://ip/devel
     * clean (tar.gz and usr)
     * cleanall (all)


Environment

STLinux 2.3 cross compiler is needed to build packages.
