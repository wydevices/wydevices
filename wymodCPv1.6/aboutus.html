<br />

 We're currently searching people with this type of profile:
  <br />
</p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Requestor: </span>Anonymous (or not) user which has the idea, they request it and provide information about the concept

  <br />
  </p>
  <p><b>WyProject Manager:</b>
Registered and involved, he should review request and if he find any
interesting, and he(she) thinks will be able to break into tasks pieces
to delegate will create a new project. This new project should have an
ammount of tasks identified by which kind of knowledge is needed
<br />
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">WyDeveloper:</span> A wydeveloper
is a highly skilled programmer that can understand and make the job. In
order to don't have a lot work to do, he will be assuming some tasks
identified by a project manager and do it. Will be nice to record the
process with GTKRecordMyDesktop. He will not need to edit and publish
the video, just record the session when doing it and upload to a shared
space (For example dropbox) other users can process the video, add the
language and even subtitles! there's no need to expend developer's time
he will just investigate and share the way a thing is done.
<br />
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">WyTester:</span> Anybody who is
just a owner and just want to help, there's no need to have any
knowledge to follow video instructions or provide feedbacks.<br />
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">WyDesigner:</span> A skilled
designer, or people who shares interest on design. For example, if a
project will be handling the GUI, a task could be to improve icons.
Maybe a wydesigner is creating the icons following some specification
from a wyproject manager, 30x30, 16 colors ... i don't know but there
are very highly skilled people out there on this area!
<br />
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">WyContent Redactor:</span> A
WyContent redactor is a person who has knowledge of writing and is
comfortable doing it, It has medium skills on computers and is able to
following instructions from the wyproject manager and notes &amp; video
from the wydeveloper in order to write articles about it on his own
language. It's very important, because it will free the wydevelopers of
explaining the details about the trick to main public. In the case some
doubt also they can ask the wydevelopers.
<br />
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">WyContent Translator:</span>
Spread the word. The only skill needed to do this task is know some
languages. I think in a open world, and the language is a problem for
european people. I will be very pleased if we're able to collaborate
each other in our original language, but, if we can also add
translation to other languages we will be able to spread the word. if
you know more language than your own, please, add yourself to this and
translate content's already added ;-)
<br />
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">WyVideo Editor:</span> People who
is interested on video edition, they will edit the footage provided by
the wydeveloper, ask for new needs to wyDesigner in order to add
materials to footage, and finally will compose the video to use on the
podcast's section.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Spread the word!<br /></p>
