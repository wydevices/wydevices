The wydevices open source development workforce

WYDEVICES: We started using this name to refer to WYplay DEVICES, as there are some different products in the market distributed by several manufacturers but they're based on a common Wyplay architecture.

Currently this project aims to provide wydevices users, a multivendor support and alternative firmware for several wydevices like Zoltar TV, Media Titan (CMT2D CMT2DW), essentielsB Mediatec or Wyplayer.

We don't support yet other architectures like VITV or SFR devices.

In order to contact the team or ask for support on installation or bugfixing, you should open a new thread on our forum: http://wydev.orgfree.com/foro/ (Registration needed)
