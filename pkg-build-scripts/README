This folder contains scripts to build packages for the wydevice.
Every package will have its build*.sh script that will build a 
tar.gz that can be directly installed under /wymedia.

STLinux 2.3 cross compiler is needed to build packages. You should
also set the compile environment variables by running in this folder

    $ . env-cross-compile.sh
