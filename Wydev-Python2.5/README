  Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package is aimed to open the python2.5 library and site-packages present in WyDevices.

Indeed Wyplay didn't release the sources of this lib and site-packages.

Python2.5 was opened with official sources from Python website.
http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.5/Python-2.5.tgz

Site-packages were decompilated with the UnPyc program modded for a better decompilation.
But decompilation isn't an exact sciences, it was a bit fastidious to obtain good results.

Anyway, a big part is now fully recovered, and it's possible to add improvements and bugfixs to the GUI ("site-packages/pygui").

  Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Boot on Wyplay firmware using BASE_FIRMWARE trick.
- Open telnet.
- Find your firmware partition.
   Type "ls /sys/block/dm-0/slaves". If result is "sda6" note "sda8", if the reslut is "sda8" note "sda6".
- Check the JFS filesystem.
   Type "fsck-jfs /dev/sdax" where "sdax" is the above noted "sda".
- Make a directory under "/wymedia".
   Type "mkdir /wymedia/root" where "root" is the dir you want to create.
- Mount the partition.
   Type "mount /dev/sdax /wymedia/root" where "sdax" is the above noted "sda" and where "root" is the dir you just created.
- Save old python2.5 library.
   Type "tar zcvf /wymedia/root/usr/lib/python2.5 /wymedia/python2.5-save.tar.gz" where "root" is the dir you just created.
- Delete python2.5 library.
   Type "rm -Rf /wymedia/root/usr/lib/python2.5".
- Checkout Wydev-Python2.5 on your computer.
   Next step is to compile svn for sh4 and directly checkout packages from our repository.
- Copy the checked-out "Wydev-Python2.5" folder as "python2.5" on the Wybox under "/wymedia/root/usr/lib".
- Reboot.


If something goes wrong, you can restore the archive "/wymedia/python2.5-save.tar.gz" using the same method to acces partitons.

  What to do next and How-to do it 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's still lot of compilated python files (".pyo") to recover.

To do so, there's a folder call "site-packages-decomp" which contain disassembled and decompilated packages files.

Inside this folder, for each ".pyo" file there's a ".py" and a ".py_asm" file.

The ".py_asm" file contain the disassembled code.
You can take a look to "Python Bytecode Instructions" chapter of this page:
http://docs.python.org/2/library/dis.html

The ".py" file contain the decompilated code.
It's not ready to debug files, but it contain a very big part of the code.
If you look at the end of the file, you'll find the code UnPyc successful decompile.
All code above is decompilation without error handling.
This allow to recover all part UnPyc failed to decompile.


Here my way to obtain a full recovered file.
It's just my way, you can do it as you want. ;)


Python code recovery:

- With Ultraedit, open the ".py" and ".pyo" files in dual mode.
- Find the last occurence of "from __future__ import absolute_import" in ".py" file. It's the start point of python code.
- At top of ".py_asm" file you can see "IMPORT_NAME         '__future__'", it's the start point of opcodes.
- Scroll both file and you'll find all opcodes in ".py_asm" file correspond to codes in ".py" file.
- If it's not the case, search fo missing code in decompilated code without error part of ".py" file and copy it if possible.
- If you don't find the code, you can rewrite it using opcodes from ".py_asm" file.
- When you think you've obtain a good result, delete the decompilated code without error part of ".py" file.

Debugging:

- Open a telnet.
- Type "ngzap splash". You obtain a "splash zapped" message.
- Type "ngstop splash". You obtain a "splash stopped" message and screen freeze.
- Type "python2.5 -O /wymedia/usr/share/pygui/skins/splash.py". The GUI restart.
- Ctrl+C stop the GUI. Line above to restart.
- If you want to activate debug message, open "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/peewee/debug.py" file and replace "log_level = logging.ERROR" by "log_level = logging.DEBUG".
- Restart the GUI to activate modification.
- You can now copy your decompilated ".py" file to "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/..." folder, and restart GUI to start debbuging.
- Be sure to never restart the Wybox with a non working GUI!!!
